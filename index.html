        <p>After receiving a Physics Degree from the University of Michigan in 1997,
          I began teaching Physics in the city of Detroit. My early experiences
          there, seeing the vast disparities between communities with and without
          resources, led to a lifelong interest in issues of equity and access for
          under-represented populations in higher education.</p>

        <p>After periods teaching in Germany and going back to U of M to pursue
          studies in Higher Education, I found myself teaching again at an urban
          school, this time in Kalamazoo, MI, and this is where I spent the
          majority of my teaching career.</p>

        <p>In addition to the daily thrill of physics problem-solving, my career
          has offered the opportunity to continually work to understand and impact
          larger global issues alongside my students. Dewey, the great philosopher
          of education, described a school as a place to develop democratic citizens,
          and a democratic citizen is one who not only participates in democracy as
          it is, but who strives to make it what it could and should become.
